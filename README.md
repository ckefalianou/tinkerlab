# TinkerLab

TinkerLab is a demo app built with Tauri.
It's a lightweight tool designed to run Laravel Artisan Tinker commands without using the command line—making it easy to copy and paste code snippets directly for testing.

The idea came from a common frustration: every time I wanted to quickly test an Eloquent command, I had to reformat it into a single line first.

So, I built this little app—initially to help myself, and eventually others too.
